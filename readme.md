The repository hosts the stylesheets for Battleground Texas.

The styles are copied directly from a WordPress theme and child theme.

The theme contains a stylesheet from the parent them, a default theme skin, a child theme, and two responsive style sheets - one for the parent them and one for the default skin.

In this respository the responsive stylesheets have been concantened onto their respective main stylesheets.

Refactoring Tasks
 * Remove uneeded styles from each stylesheet.
 * Combine styles into a single sheet.
